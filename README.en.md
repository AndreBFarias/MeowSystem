# MeowSystem

**Catppuccin for COSMIC, built for one machine — and documented well enough to become yours.**

*Everything it writes, it knows how to undo — and running it again on a ready machine writes nothing.*

Theme, icons, panel, dock, terminal and wallpaper for Pop!_OS with COSMIC in a single installer,
plus a local panel that changes all of it without opening a text file.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[REDACTED]/MeowSystem.git
cd MeowSystem
./install.sh --wizard     # first run: asks five questions, then installs
meow ativar               # every other run
```

59 steps. Running it again on a machine that is already set up **writes nothing** — and says so,
instead of listing the steps as if it had redone them. To see what would happen before letting it
happen: `MEOW_DRY_RUN=1 ./install.sh`.

## The panel

```bash
meow abrir                # or the MeowSystem icon in the launcher
```

121 settings and 50 actions across thirteen pages — one per subject, each holding everything
there is about it. The menu has two blocks: **Tópicos** (topics), which is your screen, and
**Sistema** (system), which is what the machine does on its own.

### Every block ships with a drawing, and the drawing is the control

<img src="docs/capturas/painel-leitura.png" width="920" alt="The reading-mode tab: the drawing shows the same page cold on the left and warm on the right, with the schedule below">

No control here explains itself in words alone. Each block opens with an SVG answering the
question "what does this do to my screen?", drawn from your real values — and it **repaints while
you drag the slider**, before you let go.

When a choice is waiting, the drawing becomes two: **Como está** (as it is) and **Como fica** (as
it will be), side by side, framed as buttons. Pressing "Como está" undoes that block and only
that block. The drawing sticks to the top of the page as you scroll, so it keeps being a
reference.

A drawing is never a screenshot: each one states, in its caption, exactly which numbers were
drawn.

### What you can do here

<img src="docs/capturas/painel-areas.png" width="920" alt="The workspaces tab, with a drawing of the bar and the two screens above its three settings">

- **Papel de parede** (wallpaper) — the collection, its 9 settings and 13 actions, on one
  screen. Dropping a file here says right away whether it landed in the day or the night group,
  and why — and you can disagree: **Dia** and **Noite** send an image to whichever side you want,
  and **Medir** hands the decision back to the luminance.
- **Áreas de trabalho** (workspaces) — the name and the **order** of your areas, the invisible
  padding in the name, and window tiling per area. Until now the only way was editing RON by hand.
- **Ícones** (icons) — one icon per installed program, swappable one by one, plus the theme the
  project builds.
- **Modo de leitura** (reading mode) — the warm night screen got its own page: temperature,
  texture, schedule and the ramp of the transition.
- **Install without leaving the panel** — a cursor theme `.zip`, a `.ttf` font, a base icon theme,
  a new cat, a wallpaper. The uploaded file never touches the repository: what installs it is the
  same command you would run in the terminal.
- Plus **Cor e tela**, **Logo do sistema**, **Painel e dock**, **Dia e noite**, **Terminal**,
  **Lançadores e jogos**, **Manutenção**, **Instalação** and **Atualização** — that last one runs
  `apt`, `flatpak` and `cargo` on one screen and then has `doctor` tell you what the upgrade
  undid. That second half is what a `full-upgrade` by hand doesn't have.

Every variable the installer reads has a control here — and a test enforces it, so a new key
can't be born invisible.

Clicking never changes the machine: choices pile up, and **Salvar e aplicar** writes them and runs
the installer right away. With nothing pending, the same button applies what is already saved.
The cards show what the machine has now — the dock's radius, the opacity, the clock's seconds —
and the page re-reads the machine when the job finishes. To see what would change first, the dry
run is still in the terminal: `./install.sh --dry-run`.

## What it dresses

| | |
|---|---|
| **The COSMIC theme** | All four trees, applied by file copy. Light and dark are the same theme with a switch, so switching doesn't flash the interface. |
| **The login screen** | `cosmic-greeter` keeps its own config and shipped empty: the last surface still stock. |
| **Panel and dock** | Shape, radius, margin, spacing and padding per segment; the blur that survives a maximized window; seconds on the clock; and the playing track beside it, with cover art and controls. |
| **The workspaces** | Name, order and tiling for each one. The order of the list is the order of the bar, and it is the only way to decide which area is born first. |
| **The icons** | Papirus as the base, folders tinted by the accent colour, and Arcticons glyphs per program — swappable one by one, from the panel. |
| **The terminal** | All sixteen colours, the cursor, the `starship` prompt, and the cat replacing the `fastfetch` logo, redrawn in characters on every build. |
| **The wallpaper** | A carousel with day and night folders split by luminance, next/previous on right-click, and favourites. The collection starts empty: `meow wallpaper semear` downloads the curated set, `meow wallpaper adicionar` uses images you already have. |
| **Day and night** | One schedule rules everything that asks "is it night?": the dock cat, the terminal cat, the background, and reading mode — which warms the screen and gives it paper texture, on a ramp. |
| **Programs** | Spotify, VS Code and friends themed from the inside; Steam and Heroic games with one launcher entry each, cover art included, removed when the game is. |

## Check and undo

```bash
meow doctor                            # 62 checks. Writes nothing.
meow doctor --consertar                # applies only what is out of place
meow desfazer                          # restores this machine's previous theme
meow desinstalar                       # removes theme, icons and timers
```

Every write to a system file leaves a copy behind first, and the installer **refuses by path** —
not by good intentions — to write anywhere it doesn't know.

## What to expect

This repository was born for one machine: **Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS with COSMIC**, `apt`, an RTX 4060
and her Steam `.desktop` files. That coupling is allowed and written down — absolute paths, the
`cosmic-greeter` uid, the list of programs the launcher hides. What you get in return is the
opposite of the usual: `--wizard` asks only the five essential keys, `doctor` tells you what is
out of place before the screen does, and nothing is applied without a copy of what was there
before. If your machine looks like this one, install it. If it doesn't, read `doctor` — it talks.

## Requirements

Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS · COSMIC 1.0 · `bash`, `python3` and `apt`. The panel opens in whichever browser
is already installed, and only listens on `127.0.0.1`.

## Credits

MeowSystem is a shell: almost everything you see on screen was drawn by someone else, under a
licence that allows this. The four largest:

- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) — the palette (MIT)
- [Arcticons](https://github.com/Donnnno/Arcticons) — the program and panel glyphs (CC BY-SA 4.0)

- [catppuccin/papirus-folders](https://github.com/catppuccin/papirus-folders) — the coloured folders, pinned at `f83671d1`

**The full list is in [`docs/CREDITOS.md`](docs/CREDITOS.md)** — cursors, fonts, wallpapers,
in-app themes, what was turned down and why, and what you must do if you redistribute anything
from here. (That page is in Portuguese.)
